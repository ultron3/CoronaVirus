This project puts into practice everything I have learned in two years of Its. This project aims to analyze data from positive and negative covid patients in various states of the USA.

First I create the database on Mysql Worckbench. I download the pretty table library, I have 6 features available:

1 select: print the data in the table
2 insert: I insert the data
3 delete: I delete the records by entering the name of the state
4 plot: I print the graph comparing positives and negatives
5 linear regression: same as point 4.
6 exits
default invalid option.
I have a separate file called migration.py where I migrate data from worckbench to postgresql version 16.
